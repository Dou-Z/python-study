As a middle school student, I have to learn many subjects. I want to keep up with other students, so I study very hard. Sometimes when the holiday comes, I still focus on my study. My friends ask me to have fun with them, and I refuse. Then I realize I am under great pressure all the time, even I can't sleep well. I start to change my schedule. Except for study, I spare some time to relax, such as play basketball with my friends or I will just leave myself doing nothing but enjoying music and movie. Study and play are both important part of my life. I connect them closely and live the happy life.

Changes in the way of transportation

Thanks to the rapid development of automation and new technologies, means of transportation has changed fundamentally over the last few decades. Transformed travelling modes greatly improved people’s daily life.

To start with, the cost of transportation has dropped considerably. For example, flight and train tickets are much cheaper than before. What comes along with lower prices is more options. Besides, the speed and the level of comfort during the journey has tremendously improved. Moreover, a more extensive network allows people to travel freely not only within their usual living area, but also to farther parts of the world. The complex network of roads, highways, railways and air and sea routes connects all corners of the world.

To sum up, effective transportation systems will continue to bring convenience to people's lives. Some might argue against such stance because of the pollution caused by it, yet I’m still convinced that modern transportation system can benefit all humans.
